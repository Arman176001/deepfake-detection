# üß† Deepfake Detection on Face-Swap Based Videos

A complete end-to-end AI/ML project to detect face-swapped deepfake videos using XceptionNet. Built with a scalable and production-ready architecture including a modern frontend, robust backend, containerized deployment, and observability stack.

---

## üîç Overview

Deepfakes pose a significant threat to digital authenticity. This project tackles the challenge by building a high-accuracy classifier to detect face-swapped deepfake videos using a convolutional neural network.

* **Model:** XceptionNet (CNN)
* **Dataset:** FaceForensics++
* **Frontend:** Vite + React
* **Backend:** FastAPI
* **Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose, NGINX
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### üî¨ Deep Learning Model

* Trained a deepfake detection classifier using **XceptionNet**
* Preprocessed **\~42,000 frames** from the **FaceForensics++** dataset
* Achieved **91.76% accuracy** on test set
* Trained on **2√óNVIDIA T4 GPUs** with training time under **3 hours**

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend (FastAPI)

* Exposes a `/predict` endpoint for model inference
* Handles video frame input and passes through preprocessing pipeline
* Uses `python-dotenv` to load environment variables securely
* Structured logging for debugging and traceability

### üñºÔ∏è Frontend (React + Vite)

* Built a lightweight UI for uploading video frames or images
* Shows real-time prediction results and model confidence
* Connected directly to FastAPI via REST

### üê≥ Dockerized Architecture

* Backend and frontend containerized with Docker
* All services orchestrated using Docker Compose
* `.env` support for flexible configuration

### üåê NGINX Reverse Proxy

* Serves as the single entrypoint to all services
* Handles CORS, header injection, and internal routing
* Access controlled to internal Docker network

### üìä Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana

* Custom FastAPI metrics exposed for Prometheus
* Prometheus scrapes metrics and feeds into Grafana
* Prebuilt dashboards for latency, throughput, resource usage, and errors
